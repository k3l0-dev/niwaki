# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.  The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); versions follow semver
(0.x — the API may still change between minor versions).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-11

### Changed

- **The SDK is now named `niwaki`** (庭木 — the Japanese art of sculpting
  full-size, living garden trees).  The former working name collided with an
  existing PyPI package; `niwaki` is free as both a distribution and an
  import name, and says exactly what the SDK does to the APIC Management
  Information Tree.
- Everything follows the new name: the import package (`import niwaki`),
  the clients (`Niwaki`/`AsyncNiwaki`), the nodes
  (`NiwakiNode`/`AsyncNiwakiNode`) and the exception root (`NiwakiError`).
  No behavioural change.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-10

Initial private milestone, under the project's former working name.

- Design-first architecture (ADR-001): the design DSL describes the whole
  `uni` subtree (tenant, access, fabric, controller), `push()` applies
  (`strict` / `staged` / `plan`), the facade observes (navigation, typed
  reads, queries, delete).
- 2,222 generated Pydantic models (APIC v6.0 schemas), 558 enums,
  human-readable field names with wire aliases.
- Curated vocabulary (`domain/vocabulary.yaml`), typed cursors generated per
  position, unified reference resolver (name + DN flavors, abstract targets),
  `bind_dn()` escape, atomic staged classes.
- Sync + async transport with proactive token refresh, retry, pagination.
- Sphinx documentation with a generated vocabulary book; 13,700+ unit tests,
  mypy strict.
